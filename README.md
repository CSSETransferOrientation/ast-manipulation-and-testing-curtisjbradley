# Binary Operator Simplifier 

## Completed Subtasks

**1) Automated Testing** - Tests in *mult_id*, *mult_by_zero*, *combined*, and *arith_id* will run given that there is a matching output file.

**2) Arithmetic Identiy** - *BinOpAst.additive\_identity* should be able to correctly resolve any additive identities

**3) Multiplicative Identity** - *BinOpAst.multiplicative\_identity* should be able to correctly resolve the multiplicative identity

**4) Multiply by Zero** - *BinOpAst.mult\_by\_zero* is able to resolve multiplications by 0.

**5) Combined -** *BinOpAst.simplify\_binops* runs Multiply by Zero, Arithmetic Identity, and Multiplicative Identity, in that order.


##Reflection

The most valuable part of the assignment was learning more about how unit testing works. Prior to this class I had no expericence creating tests and running testing on code.

Through this assignment I've found that I don't really enjoy the quirks of Python, especially dealing with object methods.
